# Gym Toolkit Go Game Environment

This is a custom implementation of Go game environment in Gym Toolkit. The idea is create an environment in Gym that let implement any state-of-the-art algorithm of Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

1. Create a new virtual environment with your prefered tools
2. Copy the repositiory https://github.com/jairotunior/gym_go.git
3. Install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

That's all for use.
